Hi, thanks for visiting my website!

My name is Oliver Flood, and I'm currently a master's computer science student at Oregon State University. I'm also the vice president of the [OSU ACM chapter](https://acm.oregonstate.edu) where I enjoy competitive programming. I'm working towards a career in data science & ML engineering.

<!-- Some things I love doing: solving the annual [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, struggling through [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, studying on the 2nd floor of The Valley Library, and biking when the sun comes out.  -->

Feel free to reach out using the links below!
